NN Picks tools

My name is Nenad Nikolic and I am a beginner in Python/Django world.

I am creating a Django project nnpicksdj to be able to track good Instagram photographers and create a database of them.

This project will help me learn Django programming, and in the same time help with my next projects concerning Instagram.
